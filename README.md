# GALFIT-with-Perl

This project involves generating the required inputs for GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002; Peng et al. 2010)
and running GALFIT to generate the the required science images (input image, model image, and residual image) needed
for analyzing galaxy structures.

Note:  The deeper images must be run through the entire pipeline before the shallow data because of the size of the faint signatures may not be inside postage stamp image.
